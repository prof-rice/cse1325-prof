Standard Draw
=============

Around 20 years ago, a couple of professors at Princeton named Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne wrote a very simple to use graphics library for Java named StdDraw. It still works with Java 21, which is a testament to Java's backward compatibility.

I've added a few enhancements, like adding the UTA colors and a color wheel to make more colorful art, but otherwise it's as they wrote it.

Build with ``ant`` or ``javac *.java``, then run ``java Demo``, ``java Butterfly``, and ``java Sunflower``. 

If you build with ``ant javadoc``, you'll find complete documentation for the StdDraw library at javadoc/index.html.

You can find the originals (with other example code, some of it a bit dated) at https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/.
