In Unicode, a Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) character is a 16-bit value 
(0 to 65535 or 0xFFFF, written by linguists as U+FFFF), and represented 
by the char or Character Java type. Java calls these 16-bit values 
"Unicode code unit".

Supplemental characters have values greater than 65535 or 0xFFFF, and can 
only be represented as an int, char[2], or a pair of char in a Java String. 
Java and linguists call all 1-word and 2-word characters a "Unicode code point".

Here are some examples to use in demostrating this program.

Upper case characters:
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER DZ WITH CARON: U+1C4 Ç„ 
  CHEROKEE LETTER ME: U+13BA áŽº 
  ADLAM CAPITAL LETTER LAAM: U+1E902 ðž¤‚ (supplemental - may not work)

Lower case characters:
  GREEK SMALL LETTER DELTA:  U+3B4 Î´
  ARMENIAN SMALL LETTER SHA: U+577 Õ·
  
Title case characters:
  GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI: U+1FBC á¾¼ (often looks like Ai)
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L WITH SMALL LETTER J: U+01C8 Çˆ  (often looks like Lj)

Digits:
  DIGIT FOUR: U+34 4
  ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT FOUR: U+664 Ù¤
  EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT FOUR: U+6F4 Û´
  
NOT Digits - but shouldn't they be?
  VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER: U+BC Â¼
  CIRCLED DIGIT FOUR: U+2463 â‘£
  DOUBLE CIRCLED DIGIT FOUR: U+24F8 â“¸
  DIGIT FOUR FULL STOP: U+248B â’‹
  PARENTHESIZED DIGIT FOUR: U+2477 â‘·
  SEGMENTED DIGIT FOUR: U+1FBF4 ðŸ¯´ (supplemental - may not work)
  ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR: U+2163 â…£ 

Other characters:
  BITCOIN SIGN: U+20BF â‚¿
  KANNADA SIGN SIDDHAM: U+C84 à²„
  CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPHS 5B66: U+5B66 å­¦
  DEVANAGARI LETTER YA: U+92F à¤¯
  HEBREW LETTER BET: U+5D1 ×‘
  KEYBOARD: U+2328 âŒ¨

Undefined characters:
  Reserved for private (local) use: U+E000
  Reserved non-characters: U+FFFE (signals big / little endian) and U+1FFFF
  Undefined (as of Unicode 15): U+40000 (supplemental - may not work)

The methods we'll examine below (except digit and forDigit) accept as a parameter
either a char (code unit) or an int (code point).
