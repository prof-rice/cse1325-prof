Package hello
=============

This is just a simple demo to help you understand that you should NOT allow your editor to insert "package P01.full_credit" statements in your homework assignments!

To run the program in the hello package / directory, you must compile using ``javac hello/HelloJava.java`` and run using ``java hello.HelloJava``. Package and directory hierarchies always mirror each other. We'll get to this *after the first exam*.

``HelloJava`` is a graphical application, by the way. We will do just a *bit* of this to make the lectures more interesting. You will NOT need to do this for the course - NOT on assigments and NOT on exams. If your environment doesn't run ``HelloJava``, no worries at all! We may run it in class.
