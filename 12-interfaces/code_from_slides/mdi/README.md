# Generating menu package documentation

Run ``ant javadoc`` to generate documentation for the menu package.
Open doc/api/index.html in your browser to explore the documentation.

ConciseMenu takes advantage of the features of the menu package
such as a built-in main loop, selecting from an ArrayList, and
error handling.

RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock (+ Choice) and EclecticMenuItems
demonstrate the simpler menu features discussed more fully
during the lecture.

You are free to take either approach in your class project!
